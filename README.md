# Ionide + vscode-solution-explorer

[Ionide](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp) is a wonderful editor for F# and [vscode-solution-explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fernandoescolar.vscode-solution-explorer) is a featureful tree view for .NET solutions and projects. 
This extension installs both with a bit of configuration.

Yes, I know that Ionide includes a tree view for solutions and projects, but vscode-solution-explorer supports more features like
- Listing all kinds of files (i.e. markdown, text, gitignore, notebooks, etc)
- Creating many kinds of files with templates
- Package management
- Project reference management
- Differentiating linked files
- A broader range of hot keys (i.e. `f2` to rename, `delete` to delete a file)


## Ownership and Updates
Note that this bundle is not a redistribution. Both extensions are maintained and updated by their respective owners.
The bundled extensions should update independent of this extension. This extension just shortcuts the installation and configuration.
